For the Dough:

    1 cup warm milk (about 115 degrees F)
    2 1/2 teaspoons instant dry yeast* (I like Red Star Platinum Baking Yeast)
    2 large eggs at room temperature
    1/3 cup salted butter** (Melted, but make sure it isn't over 110ยบ Fahrenheit. Just softened is fine.)
    1/2 cup granulated sugar
    1 teaspoon salt
    4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (divided)

For the Filling:

    1/2 cup salted butter (almost melted)
    1 cup packed brown sugar
    2 tablespoons cinnamon
    1/2 cup heavy cream*** (for pouring over the risen rolls)

For the Frosting:

    6 ounces cream cheese (softened)
    1/3 cup salted butter (softened)
    2 cups powdered sugar
    1/2 tablespoon maple extract (or vanilla)
    Sprinkles
